We developed a prototype model which can sense people entering into the house with the help of Infrared Sensor and on the basis of that, it can trigger the call to the owner of the house with a message to inform about intruder. Apart from automated call, We had added a feature for common electricity saving, where this chipset is linked with the mobile application for controlling all the high power consumption devices such as Air Conditioning, Fan, Light, etc. Here, we had used Arduino UNO chip set (for learning purpose) along with the Ethernet Shield W5100, where the C programming code is embedded into the Arduino chip with device having a IP address and a Mac address for uniquely identifying the device within that network. 

Our future implementation involves face-detection algorithm with the help of Web-cam and Servo motor. This would help the owner to keep intruder's image as an information.

This repository contains basic projects based on Arduino Chips.

You should be very handy with C-programming language.
